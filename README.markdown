# Parser/Lexer and REPL for a toy language:

### Pair project by Mark Johnson and George Vasels

### Fall 2011

### 5/24/12 
##  added file testfile.txt, which can be an argument when executing main method in cDriver.scala.
##  cDriver.scala is a class with a main method which is just for testing the larser/lexer.
##  cDriver.scala takes one argument, the name of a file that hopefully is valid the the toy language.

### TODO:
